# PocketAES
This repository contains a simplified implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), referred to as PocketAES. The project provides three command-line interface (CLI) programs written in Python to demonstrate encryption, decryption, and individual stages of the PocketAES algorithm.

Programs Overview:

Encryption Demonstration:

Program: D1.py
Description: This program showcases the encryption process of a single block using PocketAES. It prompts the user for a plaintext block and encryption key, then displays the results after each encryption stage, including SubNibbles, ShiftRow, MixColumns, and GenerateRoundKeys.
Individual Stage Operation

Program: D2.py
Description: This program allows users to input a text block and key in hexadecimal format. It computes and displays the outputs of individual PocketAES encryption stagesâ€”SubNibbles, ShiftRow, MixColumns, and GenerateRoundKeys. Users can visualize how each stage contributes to the overall encryption process.
Text File Encryption and Decryption

Program: D3.py
Description: This program implements the ASCII text encryption and decryption scheme defined in Section B. It reads an encrypted text file (secret.txt), decrypts it using PocketAES, and outputs the result to a plaintext file (plain.txt). Users are prompted for the encryption key, and the program takes care of null padding present in the ciphertext.
